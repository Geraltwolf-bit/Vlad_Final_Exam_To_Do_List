# Vlad_Final_Exam_To_Do_List
This program creates a CRM system that allows the user to enter, view, and delete tasks.
First, I initialize the to_do_list outside of all functions as a global variable: to_do_list = [].
Then I create the main function that unifies all other functions and runs them on user's commands.
